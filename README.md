JavaScript / ES6 implementation of algorithms from the book *Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition* by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein, famously called as the CLRS book (where CLRS in an acrynom for lastnames of the authors).

**Disclaimer**

This is not officially endorsed by the book authors or publishers. This is part of my personal learning process and practicing implementing most, if not all, algorithms from the book. Functions/methods has been named similar to the book, and tested typically with the same sample inputs mentioned in the book (so you can cross reference the code side-by-side when you are reading the book).

**Why JavaScript / ES6?**

JavaScript / ES6 has been chosen to accompany my articles that I post in my website http://codeding.com. I will try to create another repository for implementing these algorithms in a high-level programming language like C++, C# or Java. Link to that repository will be posted here when it's ready.
