This repository contains source code for accompanying articles in my website http://codeding.com, which is a "learn by experiment" platform to learn algorithms not just by reading a text but also by playing with it, meaning you can enter custom input and visually check how each step of the algorithm works. Algorithms are all about deducing computational transformation relationship between input data and output data. Articles in codeding.com helps you understand this better by showing how the data flows or transforms in each step from input form to the expected output form.
